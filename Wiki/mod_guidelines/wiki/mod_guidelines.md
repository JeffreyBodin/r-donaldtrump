# **Mod Guidelines for /r/DonaldTrump**

**⚠ ⚠**

*Become familiar with the* [***NEW Reddit Content Policies***](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) *&* [***Reddit Moderator Guidelines***](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines)*, as they will be the final deciding factor in all actions taken as a moderator.*

**⚠ ⚠**

## **★ Mission Statement/Ethos ★**

Even though /r/DonaldTrump is unabashedly a pro-Trump subreddit, we take the approach of open dialogue and free speech.  We do not ban or delete opposing views, but rather defeat them with logic, debate, and of course the ever-steady Reddit Downvote.

One of the most important parts to winning an election is to capture the undecided, independent, and moderate voting crowds.  At the same time, one of the best ways to stay away from those target audiences is to create echo chambers and safe spaces.  /r/DonaldTrump tries to stray away from creating a safe space or echo chamber, and instead strives to capture the undecided independent and moderate crowds.

We strive to enforce Reddit Policies and our specific rule set (referred to below), while also keeping in mind that allowing open dialogue in a political subreddit will create intense and sometimes heated conversations.  We do not want to delete every conversation that gets angered or heated, and want to stick to only deleting something if it truly violates the Reddit Policies or our specific rule set.

A part of this philosophy is to let the left embarrass themselves with their own hate-filled derangement and delusions.  The things we may normally find as "toxic", also appear toxic to the observing centrist, moderate, independent, etc.  This toxicity being associated with anti-Trump talking points and anti-Trump sentiment is something we do not want to hide from an audience we are trying to win over.  This association makes people question those talking points and sentiment. Rather then removing this content, we allow it to be seen by all... In addition to allowing them the opportunity to embarrass themselves, we use this as an opportunity to let our users decimate their karma and act as a counter-balance to the reddit as a whole.

## **★ Code Of Conduct ★**

- **Always act in accordance with President Trump. Never represent yourself or the r/DonaldTrump in a way that would besmirch the Office of the Presidency.**

- **Do not violate the [New Reddit Content Policies](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) outside of our subreddit, for which r/DonaldTrump could be in jeopardy of being shut down by Reddit administrators.** Note: Those who post edgy material across reddit should consider moderating from an alt account, to disassociate.

- Do your best to focus on the mod queue, unless you are undertaking other tasks as directed by the senior mod staff.

- No use of stickies for the sole purpose of gaining karma for yourself or anyone else, when possible try to find a user in discord to post important information needing stickied.

## **★ Priority Tasks (Everyone) ★** 

### **•• Mod Queue ••**

Mod Queue is filled with users reports items, Automoderator triggered reports, and all /New/ posts.  As such, it will fill up rapidly, but should offer a full picture of what is taking place in the subreddit and what moderator actions need to be taken.

Mod Queue will have 2 distinct types of content, **Topics** and **Comments**, each with a Specific Rule Set that is to be enforced.

#### ***- Topics***

The firt priority are /New/ posts.  In order to maintain a pro-Trump theme, we need to make sure that anti-Trump posts and off-topic posts do not hit our front pages.  This means that we delete ALL anti-Trump topics the moment they hit /new/.  The #1 factor to keeping the subreddit energy high and attracting new Trump supporters, is to allow our users to browse /New/ without seeing anti-Trump memes, news or other such low-energy content.

In addition to removing anti-Trump topics, we want to make sure to keep a focus on Off-Topic topics as well.  We are a Trump subreddit, and do not want our content to devolve into general "left vs right" or "culture" politics.  All topic subjects must be directly related to Trump, or topical to recent Trump activities or politics.

**TOPIC Specific Rule Set** (**TOPICS** requiring moderation):

- Violating [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)  (Rule 1) - Read and know the NEW Reddit Content Policies - **Most Important Quarantine Avoidance Priority**

- Anti-Trump Topics (Rule 3)* - No Anti-Trump topics in any capacity.

- Off-Topic Topics (Rule 4)* - All topics must relate to Trump.  [Further Details](https://www.reddit.com/r/DonaldTrump/wiki/on_off_topic)

- Race, Sex or Identity-based Slurs (Rule 6) - No Identity-based slurs and attacks.  High priority for Reddit. [Further Details](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or)

- Advocating Violence (Rule 7) - *Wishing harm*, encouraging harm, or inciting violence. [Further Details](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-violent-content)

- Reddit Drama/Brigading (Rule 8) - No linking to any other subreddit, or encouraging an attack at any specific source.  This includes references to other subreddits/users in images.

- Doxxing (Rule 9) - Any form of revealing identification or personal information of someone who is not a "Public figure" (i.e. Blue Check Mark on Social Media). [Further Details](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/posting-someones-private-or-personal)

- Advertising (Rule 11) - All advertising should be removed.

- Spam (Rule 12) - Repetitive posting of the same thing, or similar things, within a short period of time.

- No "Question" Topics (Rule 14)* - All question-based topics are to be referred to appropriate subreddits: r/AskThe_Donald & r/AskTrumpSupports

- NSFW content - Moderator discretion.  If not tagged, remove.

^* ^Topic-Only ^Specific ^Rule ^Set ^[don't ^apply ^to ^comments]

#### ***- Comments***

Even though we do not allow Anti-Trump topics at all, we do allow anti-Trump comments and discussions to exist.  Per our Ethos, we believe that allowing anti-Trump comments to exist can actually aid us in capturing undecided voters.  We have confidence in our ideas, believe in free speech, and are anti-safe-space, and should always aim to operate with these things in mind.

As stated in the Ethos, this will mean that we will refrain from removing "toxic" or "uncivil" content.  **This means on comments we will have an extra-light touch when it comes to Rule 3 (Participate In Good Faith), and Rule 13 (Adhere to Reddiquette).**  Based on our commitment to free speech, we try to avoid removing content as much as possible from the comment section. We prefer to only remove content the Reddit Admin team would take action on. Our rules act as more "guidance" for our community, as opposed to hard removal reasons. 

**COMMENT Specific Rule Set** (**COMMENTS** requiring moderation):

- Violating [Reddit Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy)  (Rule 1) - Read and know the NEW Reddit Content Policies - **Most Important Quarantine Avoidance Priority**

- Race, Sex or Identity-based Slurs (Rule 6) - No Identity-based slurs and attacks.  High priority for Reddit. [Further Details](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or)

- Advocating Violence (Rule 7) - *Wishing harm*, encouraging harm, or inciting violence. [Further Details](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/do-not-post-violent-content)

- Reddit Meta/Brigading (Rule 8) - No linking to any other subreddit, or encouraging an attack at any specific source.  This includes references to other subreddits/users in images.

- Doxxing (Rule 9) - Any form of revealing identification or personal information of someone who is not a "Public figure" (i.e. Blue Check Mark on Social Media). [Further Details](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/posting-someones-private-or-personal)

- Advertising (Rule 11) - All advertising should be removed.

- Spam (Rule 12) - Repetitive posting of the same thing, or similar things, within a short period of time.

- NSFW content - Moderator discretion.  If not tagged, remove.

#### ***- High-Priority Reports***

The following report reasons are also forwarded to Admins, so should be thoroughly reviewed before you sign off by putting your name on an approval:

- "This Is Spam"

- "Report this content under NetzDG"

- "Someone is considering suicide or serious self-harm"

### **•• TDS Flair ••**

While we are a pro-Trump subreddit that allows opposing viewpoints to exist, we do not want to become overrun with anti-Trump trolling or brigading.  As such, we have created a series of steps to deter anti-Trump trolls, while still allowing for open dialogue.  From automoderator to subreddit settings, we have implemented a variety of measures to help us maintain our Ethos while keeping the brigading trolls to a minimum.  That said, the biggest tool at moderator disposal, is the TDS flair.

All moderators have access to flair users as "TDS".  Use this power with caution, as we do not want to flair people coming in for civil dialogue. TDS Flair's should be reserved for those using term like "Trumptards", "Cheeto", or expressing other similar statements towards Trump or his supporters.  Automoderator is set to automatically report certain terms used by people who aren't already flaired TDS, and users have the ability to report others for a TDS flair, so keep your eyes out for those report details in queue.

Be cautious when using the TDS flair.  Per our Ethos, it is our goal to appeal to the non-traditional Trump voters that roam around Reddit.  As such, we dont want to flair someone TDS unless they are specifically attacking Trump, or invoking his name while attacking his specific policies or followers.  Even then, be cautious as sometimes supporters will disagree with Trump on a particular subject while still being a Trump Supporter and more importantly a Trump Voter.  We also want to avoid flairing someone TDS simply because they have an opppositional political outlook, as these are the exact people we are looking to sway in Trump's direction come time to cast a vote.  Save the TDS flair for those that truly deserve it.

#### ***- How-To Flair***

*In new.reddit* simply hover over the users name, select the "Edit user flair" option from the pop-up, and the TDS flair is the top selection.  *Mobile App* is similar, with the only difference being that you need to click the user name to open the pop-up.  *old.reddit* has to use the "Toolbox" plugin, where you click the "M" next to the user name, go to "User Flair" tab, type in "TDS" in the text flair box, and automoderator will convert the flair for you.

#### ***- Flair Effects***

1. Bans Topic Posting & Live Discussion Commenting - Users with TDS Flairs are not allowed to post topic posts, or allowed to participate in "Live Discussion" threads (typically MEGAThreads).  It is a pseudo shadow-ban, as all topics or live discussion comments that they post are instantly removed by autmoderator.  They will also be restricted from participating future features like AMAs.

2. Karma Shredding - Just as someone's "Cake Day" encourages upvotes on Reddit, a "TDS Flair" encourages downvotes on our subreddit.  As such, we act as a counter-balance to the rest of Reddit, shredding up the karma of people who normally wouldn't be engaging in places where they would lose any.

3. Collapsed Comments - We are part of Reddit "Crowd Control", which means that all news and negative karma members have their comments auto-collapsed.  As the "TDS Flair" gains quick attention for downvotes putting and keeping TDS suffered in Crowd Control mode.  This means that anti-Trump troll posts typically end up at the bottom of the comment stack and collapsed, so that you cant see them without clicking on them.  This keeps low-energy comments from interfering in the high-energy atmosphere, while still allowing us "Salt On-Tap"

4. Restricted Posting - As the "TDS Flair" keeps the users wearing it with a negative total karma in the subreddit, it automatically restricts their comment posting ability to only once every 10 minutes.  This means that if they post something and get 4-5 pro-Trump responses, they will only be able to reply to one response every 10 minutes.  This will frustrate trolls who post more often, as they wont be able to respond to all of the counter-points, and will constantly find themselves at a heavy disadvantage every time they try to make a point.

5. Flaired on r/Donald_Trump and r/DemocratsForTrump - Our Reddit Trump network now shares user flairs.  Once a user has been flaired TDS on any of the subreddits, they receive a TDS flair on the entire network.  On r/Donald_Trump and r/DemocratsForTrump this completely restricts posting, acting as a shadow-ban.


### **•• Banning Members ••**

Banning users is restricted to full-permissions moderators.  If you would like to have someone banned, pleases message a full-permissions moderator, or ping @BanMods in our Discord Channel for a quicker response.

Bans are rarely issued, and at that are reserved for Spammers, Bots, or people advocating violence or posting sexual and/or illegal content.  Bans are rarely if ever issued to users for being "toxic" or a "troll", for the reasons detailed in our Ethos (we want them to be embarrassed and have their karma destroyed).

#### ***- Operation "Border Patrol"***

While we typically do not ban individuals, we will make sure that Reddit Content Policy violators are reported to the Reddit Admins.  If we find that people are breaking the Reddit Content Policy by attacking our subreddit, we will take action to have their account suspended or possibly removed.  We feel like the approach of pursuing permanently punishment for those that attack our sub, will yield better results when it comes to keeping future attacks from occuring.

For more information, please check out the Border Patrol page: https://www.reddit.com/r/DonaldTrump/wiki/border_patrol

### **•• Stickying Content ••**

Currently Stickying Content is left to a specific "Task Force" of moderators.  The priority goals with sticky posts are to help maintain and informative balance to the meme-heavy user contributions that come into the normal subreddit feed.  Our aim is to keep our users as informed as possible to the happenings of the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency.  As such, priorities are placed on official Trump Campaign and Whitehouse information, as well as breaking news, informative memes, and other such content.
